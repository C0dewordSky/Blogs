Introduction ‚ú®

Hey everyone, I am Aakash. I am an Electrical grad transitioning to Software. I am very much into fitness. I love reading and cooking in general. Since the new year has just begun and this is my first blog, I thought of sharing my learnings and experiences from 2022.

January 2022‚ú®

It all began when suddenly one day I wasn‚Äôt able to breathe properly. It was a mild asthma attack. I suffered from asthma but that never happened earlier.

With the doctor‚Äôs consultation, I was given the medicines and the symptoms eased out after a few hours. The very next day I had an appointment and the doctor scolded the hell outta me. The test reports came and my asthma was at its peak, fatty liver and I weighed 90kgs to name a fewüò∂.

I realized that I had ruined everything the moment I reached home and looked in the mirror. It was the results of my shitty decisions that landed me in that position. I understood that I need to take charge and I had to fix it and probably it was the first best decision I took. A few days later, I joined a gym.

March‚ú®

Fast forwarding to march. It was the month when I started seeing results. The only thing I was lacking was maintaining my career and my studies. I started but couldn‚Äôt maintain the consistency and was always falling prey to instant gratification. In terms of studies, I was stuck in a cognitive slumber and I knew I had to get myself out of it. I started by taking small but consistent steps. But still, I couldn‚Äôt see instant results which made me lose track once again. I started feeling worthless.

April‚ú®

Started to focus on my thought process and self-talk. I tried to focus more on myself and less on what goes around. I wanted to get my life on track and disciplined. After a few days, I decided to quit social media for a few months.

I was a bit hesitant but I knew I had to take this step to get things back on track. Apart from this, I started investing at least 1 hour in a book every single day, reading out loud and marking the concepts I felt were important. I had it in my mind that I needed to Implement the concepts in real life to get the most out of the book, so that was the best method I could figure out.

Also, I made it a habit to work on my skills every single day no matter what. I just focused on the process of learning rather than focusing on my long-term goals.

Decemberüõ∏

Fast forwarding to December. This month probably gave me the best results. I took another big decision of quitting my current job to pursue what I truly enjoy.

In terms of my career, it made my sight very clear as to what I want to achieve in my life and what the things that I enjoy doing are. My vision is clear and I‚Äôm more focused on achieving my goals.

In terms of health, I lost 25 kgs, no more health issues and now I‚Äôm in the process to attain the ideal physique. I am not on any type of medication for the past 5 months. It‚Äôs a win.üßø

Conclusionüõ∏

The journey of improvement and learning is never ending and mine is far from over. This journey has taught me a lot and I‚Äôm somewhere happy that I didn‚Äôt give up. Any circunstance is the result of your past decisions. Now it‚Äôs all about focusing on self, building, creating, learning and growing in public.

I am thankful to the Universe for everything. Gratitude‚ù§Ô∏è.
