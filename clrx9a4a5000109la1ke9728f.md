## What is Linux?

Linux is a Unix-based open-source Operating System developed by Linus Torvalds in September 1991. There are a tons of operating systems that use Linux as their base. Technically they are called ***"Linux Distributions"*** or ***"Flavors"*** . Some of the widely used ***Linux Flavors*** are Debian, Ubuntu, Kali Linux to name a few.

Let's Understand It's Architecture to the very basics:

Linux Architecture Diagram

### Kernel:

The [**kernel**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kernel-in-operating-system/) is the core component of an operating system. This provides a platform for programs and various services to run on top of it. The Linux Kernel is written in **C Language** and it talks directly with the hardware. All the commands that run on a Linux system are written in C and stored in the kernel.

### Shell:

It is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to interact with the operating system. Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files.

Enough of the basic theory, Now let's heads up to some basic Commands

## Linux Basic Commands:

### Some Basic Commands:

1. To list all the files in a directory(folder) :
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
2. To Make a Directory:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir <file_name>
    ```
    
3. To make a file:
    
    ```bash
    touch <file_name>
    ```
    
4. To make a directory and a file inside of it in one command:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir -p <directory_name>/<file_name>    : -p flag stands for parent i.e. first parent i.e. directory will be created and then the child i.e file . 
    ```
    
5. To check the user:
    
    ```bash
    whoami
    ```
    
6. To check the path of present directory i.e. Directory you are currently in:
    
    ```bash
    pwd
    ```
    
7. To print on screen:
    
    ```bash
    echo
    ```
    
8. To read the contents of a file:
    
    ```bash
    cat <file_name>
    ```
    
9. To seek help for a command:
    
    ```bash
    [command] --help    This will tell you about the details of the command.
    ```
    
10. List all files in a directory including hidden ones:
    
    ```bash
    ls -a     the -a flag is used to display all files including the hidden ones. 
    ```
    

### Understanding a command:

Understanding a command is the most crucial part when starting with Linux. It looks complex but is straight and easy. Lets Understand it using a few examples:

* **C**o**p**y : **cp**
    
* **C**hange **D**irectory : **cd**
    
* **L**i**s**t : **ls**
    
* **M**a**k**e **Dir**ectory: **mkdir**
    

In these examples we can see few bold letters, this pattern is carried on throughout Linux commands be it basics or even advanced.

## Summary

Linux is an open-source operating system with distributions like Debian and Ubuntu. Its architecture includes a kernel (core component) and a shell (user interface). Basic commands include "ls" (list files), "mkdir" (make directory), and "touch" (make file). Other commands like "whoami," "pwd," and "echo" perform user-related tasks. Using "--help" with a command provides details. Commands follow consistent patterns, like "cp" for copy and "cd" for change directory.

Hope you find this insightful. Ending this with a beautiful quote by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds himself-

> The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it.

Happy Learning.
