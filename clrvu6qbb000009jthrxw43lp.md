## What is DevOps?

In the dynamic world of tech, DevOps emerges as the harmonious blend of "Development" and "Operations." Picture this: Development crafts the project from scratch, while Operations gracefully deploys and makes it accessible to users.

At its core, DevOps is a methodology that elegantly streamlines the software delivery journey – from code inception to deployment and ongoing maintenance. Along with automating Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) seamlessly.

In simple terms, DevOps is the silent force propelling your software from creation to the hands of users, all while ensuring efficiency and automation at every step.

## What is Automation, Scaling and Infrastructure ?

### Automation

Automation is a self explanatory word that means to automate a process. Imagine a process where human intervention is minimized, errors are reduced to a whisper, and the heavy lifting is gracefully shouldered by the power of automation. Sounds great, right? Well that's what automation does and you can focus on the exciting part of building the product while all the other heavy lifting is being already taken cared of.

### Scaling

Scaling is the process of expanding and shrinking your system and practices as you need them.

Have you ever thought how streaming apps handle millions of followers watching a live stream? There comes the use of scaling. The system are "scaled up" i.e. increased when the traffic increases and the system is "Scaled Down" i.e. reduced when the traffic decreases.

### Infrastructure

In DevOps, infrastructure or DevOps Infrastructure refers to a concept that revolves around the idea of managing infrastructure with the help of code. Which in simple word means you can write a code and your entire infrastructure will be deployed.

This can be achieved via certain tools like "Terraform" which we'll go in depth in the upcoming days.

## Why DevOps is Important?

DevOps is crucial because it bridges the gap between development and operations, fostering collaboration and automation. It accelerates software delivery, ensures reliability, and enhances efficiency, leading to faster innovation, reduced errors, and improved overall business performance. In essence, DevOps is the heartbeat of modern software development, enabling organizations to adapt quickly to changing market demands and deliver high-quality products with agility.

I hope this blog helped you understand the basics of DevOps. Don't rush, in the upcoming days we will be learning in depth about each and every concepts involved.

Ending this with a beautiful quote by Jez Humble.

> DevOps is not a goal, but a never ending process of continual improvement.

Thank you and Happy learning ✨
